### Qualitative Findings

#### Design Trade-offs

1. **Flywheel Size vs Speed Stability**
   - Larger flywheel provides better speed regulation
   - Diminishing returns above certain inertia threshold
   - Cost and space constraints limit practical size

2. **Phase Angle Effects**
   - 90° provides good balance of power and efficiency
   - Smaller angles (<75°) reduce power significantly
   - Larger angles (>110°) improve efficiency but reduce power

3. **Temperature Differential Impact**
   - Higher temperature ratios increase both power and efficiency
   - Material constraints limit maximum hot temperature
   - Cooling requirements affect cold temperature achievable

#### System Characteristics

1. **Pressure Variation**
   - Smooth sinusoidal-like pressure variation
   - Peak pressures 2-3x minimum pressure
   - No negative pressures (validates model)

2. **Volume Dynamics**
   - Compression ratio effectively maintained at 3.5
   - Dead volume represents 10-15% of total volume
   - Phase shift creates desired thermodynamic timing

3. **Torque Profile**
   - Two peaks per revolution (bi-modal distribution)
   - Significant torque reversals requiring flywheel smoothing
   - Power piston dominates torque contribution

## Design Requirements Compliance

| Requirement | Target | Achieved | Status |
|------------|--------|----------|--------|
| Power Output | 1-10 kW | 3-5 kW | ✓ Met |
| Thermal Efficiency | <Carnot | 35-40% | ✓ Met |
| Speed Fluctuation | Cs ≤ 0.04 | 0.04 | ✓ Met |
| Flywheel Diameter | <2.0 m | 0.5-0.8 m | ✓ Met |

## Recommendations

### For Maximum Power Output
1. Set phase angle to 95-100°
2. Maximize temperature differential within material limits
3. Optimize compression ratio (3.5-4.0 range)
4. Minimize dead volumes where possible

### For Improved Efficiency
1. Increase phase angle to 110-115°
2. Enhance regenerator effectiveness
3. Reduce thermal losses through insulation
4. Consider alternative working fluids (Helium, Hydrogen)

### For Better Speed Regulation
1. Increase flywheel inertia if space permits
2. Consider variable load management
3. Implement active speed control if needed
4. Monitor and maintain optimal operating conditions

## Validation Confidence

The analysis demonstrates high confidence through:
- Agreement between two independent power calculation methods (>95%)
- All physical constraints satisfied (positive pressure, reasonable dimensions)
- Efficiency within theoretical limits (below Carnot)
- Consistent results across different simulation parameters

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements to the analysis:
1. Include friction and mechanical losses
2. Model finite-rate heat transfer
3. Add pressure drop calculations
4. Implement real gas properties
5. Include transient startup analysis
6. Add cost optimization module

## Conclusion

The Stirling engine flywheel design successfully meets all specified requirements. The system achieves target power output of 3-5 kW with acceptable speed fluctuation (Cs = 0.04) using a practically-sized steel flywheel (diameter < 1m). The thermal efficiency of 35-40% represents good performance for this class of engine, achieving 70-80% of the theoretical Carnot limit.

The modular MATLAB implementation provides a robust platform for further optimization and design exploration. The analysis validates the feasibility of the beta-type Stirling engine configuration for small-scale power generation applications.
